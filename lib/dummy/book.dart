      "The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a tragic tale of love, wealth, and illusion set in 1920s America. Narrated by Nick Carraway, the novel follows the enigmatic millionaire Jay Gatsby, who throws lavish parties in hopes of reuniting with his lost love, Daisy Buchanan. As Gatsby’s dream collides with reality, the story exposes the moral decay beneath the glittering surface of the American Dream. Themes of obsession, social class, and disillusionment permeate the narrative, culminating in a powerful critique of a society driven by greed and status. Gatsby's fate serves as a poignant symbol of unattainable ideals.",
